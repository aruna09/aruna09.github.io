### Hi there 👋

I am a Software Engineer at Philips Health Systems and am passionate about how machines can work wonders with a little data and the right math😉

On weekdays I am swamped with work around creating Design Documents(finally getting to use all the stuff learned in college), implementing logic using OOP and Design patterns(yes, I actually used it) and end to end testing. On weekends I go on treks or I attack Kaggle and pick up a random dataset to work on.

## Here's some of my work👨‍💻👨‍💻


### Bellabit Fitbit Tracker Data Analysis

**Context**

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. In this case study I analyze smart device fitness data that could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. My foucs is on understanding Bellabeat’s products to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will help us discover marketing strategy for the company.

### Coursera Course Data Analysis - Dashboard

This is one of my first experimental [dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/d8ac9137-3b19-4f87-86c2-3a4ee70adabe/page/fErSC) using googledata studio with the Coursera Course Dataset from Kaggle. It was pretty fun building this, and I learnt a lot not just in terms of how to make such amazing visualizations but also on how to interpret data and tell a story.

### Predicting Music Genre

**Context**

Who doesn't love songs?! 
This is a little side problem I picked up on a weekend to solve. Every song has a different measure of accousticness, the daceability factor, energy, duration, liveliness etc. Features like these have been extracted and documented in a dataset which is used here to predict the Music Genre.

**Story behind the scenes**

Well wanted to buy a Monitor for work and while shortlisting one, realized that this would be a great problem to work on.
Came up with a quick script(wasn't quick at all, lol) using python and selenium to scrape data and saved it to csv.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aruna1234/amazon-data-monitor-deals) is published on Kaggle!
